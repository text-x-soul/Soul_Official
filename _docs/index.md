The Soul file format is universal. However, implementations may vary with how they function. 
You should start by learning the syntax and then downloading a suitable implementation for the platform you are working with.

Implementations are currently available for Native C++, Python, Java and Qt. You can download them from the [Download section](https://text-x-soul.tk/download.html).

The current format is **0.5.2** and the documentation is written according with that.

## Requirements
### `C++`
- If you are natively developing on C++, then you may require **C++ Revision >= 17** in most cases. Compiler can be anything you want but it should support the standard.

### `Qt`
- If you are on Qt, then you may require **C++ Revision >= 17** and **Qt Version >= 5.0**.

### `Java`
- No Specific requirements.

### `Python`
- It is recommended to have **Python version >= 3.0**.
