              <p class="lead">Soul is a file format implemented for a simple conversation of data, messages and functionality through
                  digital means no matter what platform you are in, what framework or any programming language you are writing code. 
                  This helps in avoiding use of large libraries for reading streams of data, importing large files, using 
                  system-relative links, etc.</strong>.</p>

            <p>The Soul file format is intended to have very short, easy and reliable syntax that even a baby can understand ;) 
                As the format updates, new parsers and readers are developed quickly for your convenience.

            <h3 class="text-center">Easily Importable and Highly Accessible</h3>
            <p>The Soul file format was implemented for a simple conversation of data, messages and functionality through digital means 
                no matter what platform you are in, what framework or any programming language you are writing code. This helps in 
                avoiding use of large libraries for reading streams of data, importing large files, using system-relative links, etc.</p>

                defined thus far, you can extend the format for free, reimplement your own version of the standard and keep it in 
                touch with your software.</p>
